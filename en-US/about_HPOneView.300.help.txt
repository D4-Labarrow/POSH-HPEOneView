SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HP OneView 3.00
	
WHAT'S NEW

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    *** IMPORTANT ***
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    The HPE OneView 3.0 PowerShell library is removing Positional Parameters, which will break
    existing scripts.  This change is needed to address ongoing support issues with PowerShell scripts
    and to conform to Microsoft's Best Practice to not use Positional Parameters.

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    *** IMPORTANT ***
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Release 3.0.1128.2242
     -- [#177] Enhanced New-HPOVServerProfileConnection to allow null -MAC parameter for FC only type
        connection (for non-CNA connections).
     -- [#178] Fixed New-HPOVLogicalInterconnectGroup where when building the LIG object, an array index number would
        inadvertantly return back to the Cmdlet caller.
     -- [#179] Fixed regression in New-HPOVNetwork where TypicalBandwidth or MaximumBandwidth would not be set.
     -- Fixed Add-HPOVServer and Add-HPOVEnclosure where if resource was being managed by another external Manager
        and a DNS PTR record didn't exist, would cause an exception with System.Net.Dns.GetHostByName() method.
     -- Fixed installer where modifying the PSModulePath system environment variable would require a reboot is no longer
        necessary in order to use module short hand name when using Import-Module.
     -- Added Remove-HPOVScmbCertificate Cmdlet to remove generated SCMB certificates from an appliance.
     -- Enhanced Update-HPOVLogicalEnclosure and Update-HPOVLogicalInterconnect -WhatIf parameters to return
        a compare object with what the child Logical Interconnect is different from parent Logical Interconnect
        Group.

    Release 3.0.1121.2161
     -- Initial 3.00 release.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

        • Connect-HPOVmgmt
        • Send-HPOVRequest
        • New-HPOVResource
        • Set-HPOVResource
        • Remove-HPOVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
