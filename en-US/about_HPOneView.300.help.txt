SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HP OneView 3.00
	
WHAT'S NEW

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    *** IMPORTANT ***
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    The HPE OneView 3.0 PowerShell library is removing Positional Parameters, which will break
    existing scripts.  This change is needed to address ongoing support issues with PowerShell scripts
    and to conform to Microsoft's Best Practice to not use Positional Parameters.
    
    Starting with 3.0.1142.2291, Exception Handling will change only for Get-HPOV* and Disconnect-HPOVMgmt 
    Cmdlets when providing the -Name parameter.  Instead of generating a TerminatingError, these Cmdlets 
    will support -ErrorAction.  To trap those errors, use the -ErrorAction Stop parameter value.  To ignore 
    the error, instead use -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue.  Authentication errors are still TerminatingErrors
    with those Cmdlets.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

        • Connect-HPOVmgmt
        • Send-HPOVRequest
        • New-HPOVResource
        • Set-HPOVResource
