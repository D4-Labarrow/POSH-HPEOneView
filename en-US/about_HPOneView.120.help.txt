SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HP OneView 1.20
	
WHAT'S NEW 

    Release 1.20.0.0007
	 -- Branch to HP OneView 1.10 Release.  NOTE:  This library version does not support older appliance versions.
	 -- Fixed New-HPOVUplinkSet where FibreChannel Uplink Set objects were not being created with uplink ports 
	    (logicalPortConfigInfos).
	 -- Fixed Connect-HPOVMgmt to trap HTTP 401 Unauthorized request to get appliance roles after successfully 
	    connecting to appliance when user has insufficient privileges.
	 -- Fixed Remove-HPOVNetwork pipeline input.
	 -- Fixed New-HPOVProfile where firmware baseline URI was printed to the screen causing the callers variable 
	    to store the task object to become a System.Array type.
	 -- Fixed New-HPOVBackup where backup file would not download.
	 -- Fixed Add-HPOVStoragePool where the API changed.
	 -- Fixed Wait-HPOVApplianceStart where the appliance web services needed an additional few seconds to finish 
	    their init.
	 -- Added new parameters to Get-HPOVVersion; -CheckOnline and -ReleaseNotes. CheckOnline will check for newer 
	    library version on GitHub, and ReleaseNotes will display the found update's Release Notes.
	 -- Added Invoke-HPOVVcmMigration cmdlet for Virtual Connect Manager migrations to HP OneView.
	 -- Updated New-HPOVBackup to increase the timeout waiting for the create backup file async task to complete.
	 -- Updated Send-HPOVRequest to generate terminating error for HTTP 401 Insufficient Privileges and not just 
	    for invalid session.
	 -- Updated Set-HPOVManagedSan to support new API calls, and depricated both -EnableAutomatedZoning and 
	    -DisableAutomatedZoning parameters.	

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

        • Connect-HPOVmgmt
        • Send-HPOVRequest
        • New-HPOVResource
        • Set-HPOVResource
        • Remove-HPOVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
